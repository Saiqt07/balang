            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Born in a little neighborhood where everything started.<sup><b>1</b></sup>  
                My life as a kid with no knowledge of everything started my whole fate.<sup><b>2</b></sup>  
                Cry baby as a kid, just an innocent child who does not yet know the dream of life.<sup><b>3</b></sup>  
                Wandering outside the house to gather future friends on the road.<sup><b>4</b></sup>  
                Make enemies but then become friends in the end.<sup><b>5</b></sup>  
                It is more solid to be friends with those who have become your enemies because you can say that you are true to each other.<sup><b>6</b></sup>  
                As I grew up, I gradually learned about right and wrong.<sup><b>7</b></sup>  
                It's good to be young, especially if you're just starting to learn about things in the world.<sup><b>8</b></sup>  
                Sometimes I can't avoid being stubborn because all I used to know was to play, sleep, and eat.<sup><b>9</b></sup>  
                I still remember my friends when I was a child.<sup><b>10</b></sup>  
                I am very grateful that they were a part of my youth.<sup><b>11</b></sup>  
                Although my friends and I often fight, our solid friendship is still more dominant because in the end, we are the only ones together whenever we are outside our house.<sup><b>12</b></sup>  
                As I grow up, I also know little by little how this is and how that is.<sup><b>13</b></sup>  
                As a stubborn child, I gradually understood that what my parents were telling me was right.<sup><b>14</b></sup>  
                It's wrong for someone like me to make mistakes; I'm just a human being like most people.<sup><b>15</b></sup>  
                I miss being a kid so much because I enjoy every moment more as I grow up.<sup><b>16</b></sup>  
                If I had to choose if I wanted to be a child again, I would agree because I can say that it is better to be a child without thinking about problems.<sup><b>17</b></sup>  
                Childhood taught me the value of simple joys and unconditional friendships.<sup><b>18</b></sup>  
                Those early years shaped my curiosity about the world around me.<sup><b>19</b></sup>  
                Looking back, I realize how those childhood experiences formed the foundation of who I am today.<sup><b>20</b></sup></p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Fast forward to my teenage years, when I turned 13 years old.<sup><b>1</b></sup>  
                I was so happy because I was waiting for this moment.<sup><b>2</b></sup>  
                I always wanted to be a teenager because I was very curious when I was a child about what life is like as a teenager.<sup><b>3</b></sup>  
                Little by little, I realized as a teenager that my friends are decreasing, and they are being replaced by those who become my friends at school.<sup><b>4</b></sup>  
                Because there really is no permanent thing or person in your life here in the world we all stand in.<sup><b>5</b></sup>  
                You also learn more, especially in life, because you interact with different kinds of people in school.<sup><b>6</b></sup>  
                It's also fun to be a teenager because you know little by little what life will be like when you finish school.<sup><b>7</b></sup>  
                You will have enemies, and you can't tell if they will be your friends like when we were kids.<sup><b>8</b></sup>  
                We don't all think the same way, so you can't just go with anyone at our age.<sup><b>9</b></sup>  
                For me, teenagers are the most dangerous and the happiest part of our lives because we are often tempted by something.<sup><b>10</b></sup>  
                It's fun because you can see more who are real than not.<sup><b>11</b></sup>  
                My happiest chapter of my studies was my high school life because I met many true friends who are still my friends to this day.<sup><b>12</b></sup>  
                Many temptations came to me, and I thank myself because I was able to control all the temptations around me as a teenager.<sup><b>13</b></sup>  
                I am very thankful for the people around me when I was a teenager because I also learned a lot of things from them and what is right and what is wrong.<sup><b>14</b></sup>  
                I will miss my teenage life so much because during that time, there were fewer thoughts and problems in life.<sup><b>15</b></sup>  
                Those years taught me about responsibility and independence in ways childhood never could.<sup><b>16</b></sup>  
                I discovered my passions and interests that would guide my future decisions.<sup><b>17</b></sup>  
                The challenges of adolescence helped me develop resilience and problem-solving skills.<sup><b>18</b></sup>  
                Looking back, I appreciate how my teenage years balanced freedom with growing responsibilities.<sup><b>19</b></sup>  
                The friendships formed during this period remain some of the most meaningful in my life.<sup><b>20</b></sup></p>

            <blockquote>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">As a college student, it can be said that this is where my journey in life began.<sup><b>1</b></sup>  
                Because of this, we will know what we will be when the time comes when I graduate from school.<sup><b>2</b></sup>  
                Others are right in saying that college life is very different compared to our teenage life.<sup><b>3</b></sup>  
                I also realized that we are the only ones who will make the direction of our lives.<sup><b>4</b></sup>  
                This college life is also like a survival game because you are the only one who will save yourself in times when you are drowning.<sup><b>5</b></sup>  
                You have no one to rely on but yourself whenever there are trials that go through our college life.<sup><b>6</b></sup>  
                It depends on our own hands what we will be in the future; our parents only help us in our studies, like expenses, bills, etc.<sup><b>7</b></sup>  
                But in the end, we are still the ones who can do or say what we are or what we will achieve in the future.<sup><b>8</b></sup>  
                I also met a lot of college friends and different people in what I am now.<sup><b>9</b></sup>  
                As a 2nd-year college student, I can say that it is difficult to get along with other people or schoolmates because people think so differently now that I am in college compared to when I was in high school.<sup><b>10</b></sup>  
                Every day I think about my life when I was just in high school, which was so much fun and almost no problem to think about.<sup><b>11</b></sup>  
                I am very grateful to my friends since I was in high school because I learned a lot from them and experienced things that made me happy that I thought I would never be able to do in my whole life.<sup><b>12</b></sup>  
                College has taught me the importance of time management and self-discipline.<sup><b>13</b></sup>  
                I've learned to balance academic responsibilities with personal growth and social life.<sup><b>14</b></sup>  
                The challenges of higher education have pushed me to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.<sup><b>15</b></sup>  
                I've discovered new interests and potential career paths through my coursework.<sup><b>16</b></sup>  
                College has shown me the value of networking and building professional relationships.<sup><b>17</b></sup>  
                I've learned to appreciate different perspectives through interactions with diverse classmates.<sup><b>18</b></sup>  
                The independence of college life has helped me become more self-reliant and confident.<sup><b>19</b></sup>  
                These years are shaping me into the person I will become in my professional and personal life.<sup><b>20</b></sup></p>
